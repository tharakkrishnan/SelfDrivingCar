# Traffic Sign Recognition Program

### Overview

In this project, we will use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. We will train a model so it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, we will then test the model program on new images of traffic signs you find on the web.

### Dependencies

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
- [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org)

Run this command at the terminal prompt to install [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/). Useful for image processing:

- `conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3`

### Dataset

1. Download the dataset. You can download the pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32 [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/580d53ce_traffic-sign-data/traffic-sign-data.zip).
