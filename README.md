# Self-Driving Car Projects

## 1. Finding lanes in a video stream using OpenCV
* Use openCV, Canny edge detector, Hough transform and region of interest masks to build a simple lane detection pipeline

## 2. Identifying traffic signs using Tensorflow
* Use Tensor-flow and Convolutional neural-networks (CNNs) to classify different types of traffic signs.

## 3. Behavioral Cloning using Keras
* Use a car simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road

## 4. Advanced lane detection pipeline
* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## 5. Vehicle Detection pipeline
* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run the pipeline on a video stream and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

## 6. Extended Kalman filter
* Use an extended Kalman filter to predict the path of a moving object  based on LIDAR and RADAR data 
## 7. Unscented Kalman filter
* Use an unscented Kalman filter to predict the path of a moving object  nbased on LIDAR and RADAR data
## 8. Particle Filters
* Use Particle filters to localize an object moving within a known map
## 9. PID controller
* Use a PID controller to control the steering of a vehicle within the lane
## 10. Model predictive control
* Use a Kinematic model to more accurately control the steering of the vehicle even at high speeds
